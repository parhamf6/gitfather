# 🤖 The Gitfather

> *“I'm gonna make you a commit you can't refuse.”*

**The Gitfather** is a personal automation bot for Git operations, built with style and efficiency. Inspired by *The Godfather*, this project adds a touch of organized automation to your git workflow — all under your control.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

The Gitfather automates:

- Randomized commit messages (optional time/number generators)
- Git commit & push sequences
- Telegram bot interaction for remote control
- YAML-based configuration per user
- Simple database management (JSON/SQLite)
- CLI interface for local or terminal-based control

This project is modular and fully customizable — tailored for developers who want power, control, and a bit of fun in their workflow.

This project is **not a hosted service** and **not maintained as a public API**.
